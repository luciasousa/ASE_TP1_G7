Application to compare CPU and GPU
Two programs: operation.cu and palindrome.cu
The program Operation is a program that implements a heavy task.
The task is the sum of the squares of two arrays, the result is saved in another array.
This operation is calculatem 10000 times.
The program Palindrome is a program to calculate if an array of chars is a palindrome.
Its a simpler task and the CPU here will have a better performance than GPU. In contrast to operation task.
For the function to run in CUDA kernel it was used 1024 blocks which with 1024 threads.
