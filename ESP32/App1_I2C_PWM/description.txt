Application 1 - I2C and PWM
1. Start with initializing LEDC module:
    a. Set the timer of LEDC first, this determines the frequency and resolution of PWM.
    b. Then set the LEDC channel and bind with one of the timers.
    c. LED is connected to GPIO 5
2. Setup the temperature sensor.
3. Read temperature and compare it to the previous temperature value.
    a. If the temperature has increased then led is off and turned on, fade up
    b. If the temperature has decreased then led is on and turned off, fade down
    c. If the temperature doesn't change, led stays turned off
